## 🧭 About This Blog

This blog explores the intersection between industrial automation, SCADA systems, and modern software engineering. It's a space to share insights from real-world experience in automation design, cybersecurity in control systems, and the integration of AI tools (like GPT-based assistants) to optimize industrial workflows.

Here, you'll find technical breakdowns, tutorials, and reflections on the evolution of automation — from PLC programming to prompt engineering.
